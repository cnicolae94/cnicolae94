- 👋 Hi, I’m @cnicolae94!
- 👀 I’m interested in many things! I like learning new concepts, solving puzzles and problems, 
chess, reading and travelling(but everyone has those listed, right?).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C++, C#, SQL and PL/SQL mostly for school but I enjoy Java the most.
- 💞️ I’m currently looking for an internship so I can advance my knowledge in Object oriented programming 
and data structures. Friends would describe me as hard working, headstrong and ambitious with a sprinkle 
or two of optimism. I look forward to collaborating on new and interesting projects!
- 📫 How to reach me? Either on my linked in which is /in/claudia-nicolae or through E-mail
nclaudia0127@gmail.com.
